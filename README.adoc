== tradepr-proj
The work tradepr-proj is comprised of tradepr-ansible-server,
tradepr-clj-server, and tradepr-react.

=== What is this about
tradepr-proj is a work in progress.
Here, I am using the latest technologies such as hapi.js ( http://hapijs.com ),
react ( https://github.com/facebook/react ),
redux ( http://redux.js.org ), and
ES2015 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript ) to create an isomorphic
(aka. universal or server rendered) node.js ( https://nodejs.org/ ) app.
It also uses ansible ( https://github.com/ansible/ansible )
and Clojure ( https://clojure.org/ ).

 $ vagrant up
 $ ansible-playbook tradepr.yml

=== If you got this far, what are you looking at?
You are looking at Puerto Rico's top import/export destinations by year and month.
The data comes from the Puerto Rico Statistics Institute.  The database used can be
found at
http://www.estadisticas.pr/iepr/Estadisticas/Basesdedatos/Economia.aspx#CEPR

If you are feeling underwhelmed at the lack of graphs come back when there are more graphics.
At the moment, my aim is to create something in the spirit of the US Census Foreign Trade
website which can be seen at
http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/graphs/TopPartners.html
So far, I have focused on building a foundation that will support what is coming.

=== Clean up when you are done
.Perform these steps:
----
 $ To stop the hapi.js server hit Ctrl-C at the command line where the gulp process is running
 $ cd ../tradepr-ansible-server/
 $ vagrant destroy
----
