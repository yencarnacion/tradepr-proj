== tradepr-proj
The work tradepr-proj is comprised of tradepr-ansible-server,
tradepr-clj-server, and tradepr-react.

=== What is this about
tradepr-proj is a work in progress.
Here, I am using the latest technologies such as hapi.js ( http://hapijs.com ),
react ( https://github.com/facebook/react ),
redux ( http://redux.js.org ), and
ES2015 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript ) to create an isomorphic
(aka. universal or server rendered) node.js ( https://nodejs.org/ ) app.
It also uses ansible ( https://github.com/ansible/ansible )
and Clojure ( https://clojure.org/ ).
